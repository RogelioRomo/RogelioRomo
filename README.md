### üßë‚ÄçüöÄ My journey as a developer

All started back in higschool where I learned how to code with arduino for some school projects (line follower robots) and going to state universities competitions as a highschooler. I entered university and choose to study aerospace engineering, although I like coding my passion for the space and astronomy is bigger. There I developer a lot of skills in that area but I also had different classes for programming like matlab, and C++ coding lessons developing small projects. I obtained my graduate degree with good grades and after a few months I started working in a manufacturing company and lasted 2 years. I enjoyed my time there and learned a lot of stuff like working with crossfunctional teams, to resolve problems efficiently, to lead projects and document them, etc.
But... I wasn't feeling it, the manufacturing business was not for me, so I decided to launch myself into new adventures and started to learn software development and I have to say... I love it! and I'm here improving every day and expecting this to be my full time hobby/job.
